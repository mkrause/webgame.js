WebGame.js

# Overview
This framework is intended to make it easier to write games using JavaScript 
and HTML5's 2D Canvas drawing API. In particular, the framework currently
takes care of the following things:

 - Game loop and timing
 - User events
 - Resource management (image and audio loading)

Future versions may also also provide useful abstractions for things like
drawing and animation.

# Examples/demo
See the tests/ directory for some simple examples, including a basic pong game
written using WebGame.js.
